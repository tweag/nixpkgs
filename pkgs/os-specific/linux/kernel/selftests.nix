  # A handful of selftests (e.g. bpf, landlock, exec, x86) link some of
  # their binaries with `-static`, which requires glibc's static
  # archives. `stdenv.cc.libc` (the dynamic glibc) must be listed
  # *before* `stdenv.cc.libc.static` here: buildInputs are added to
  # NIX_LDFLAGS as `-L` flags in order, and since static glibc's output
  # only contains `.a` files (no `.so`), putting it first would make
  # the linker pick the static libc for every binary -- including
  # dynamically-linked host tools like the kernel's own `fixdep` --
  # which breaks at runtime with an IFUNC circular dependency error.
  # Listing the dynamic glibc first ensures `ld` resolves `libc.so`
  # there for ordinary links, while `-static` links (which only look
  # for `.a` files) still fall through to the static archive.
