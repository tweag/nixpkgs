# Nixpkgs Maintainers

The *Nixpkgs maintainers* are people who have assigned themselves to
maintain specific individual packages. We encourage people who care
about a package to assign themselves as a maintainer. When a pull
request is made against a package, OfBorg will notify the appropriate
maintainer(s).
